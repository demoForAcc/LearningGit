### Learn how to create file locally on your machine

1. Create a text file. Save it as *.md
2. Edit and save as usual you do with your other files.
3. The repository on GitHub and your local machine now has one different file. It should be noted
   that the change you made locally is still not available on GitHub page.
4. To see the change on your GitHub account, you have to PUSH the file.
5. Steps:

    a. First, we will add the file to the staging area(a check-in point before finalizing and 
   pushing the content on the GitHub page) using "git add" command. 
   
    b. Second, we have to commit the change using "git commit" command.
    
    c. Third, we push the file on to the cloud i.e nothing but your GitHub page using "git push" command.
